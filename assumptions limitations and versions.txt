Assumptions:

I have presumed that we only want to store the country that has been searched for.

I have also presumed that we do not want them to submit anything until a result has been found.


Limitations:

I ran out of time to do the full name search. I would have put in a checkbox and added the data in the input boxes as it currently does.

I also didn't have time to fix the json that comes back in the input boxes for currency and langauges.

I also didn't have time to alter the system to there is a display box as you could currently alter the values as they appear and enter the wrong data in the db.

The idea was to have a display area that shows the data so the input boxes would not affect it, when it goes into the db.
